<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I am Mehul. Currently 20 years old studying in VIT Vellore in a 4 Year Btech course which specializes in computer science and focuses
  on deep learning of the various things that are happeing around us by observing closely in the regular domain.</p>

<p>I have a family of 4, I have one sibling. </p>

<p>I love to read various science fiction books, and philosphical thoughts, my particular interest lies in listening to calm 
  and soothing music which also acts as a stress buster for me in my hectic computer science degree.
